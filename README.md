## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript

- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 (Flash & Pro Vision) via `@google/genai` SDK
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tooling**: Vite

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher)
2.  **npm** or **yarn**
3.  A valid **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one for free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sharp-AI.git
    cd Sharp-AI
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. Add your API key:

    ```env
    # .env
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

    *Note: The application expects `process.env.API_KEY` to be available. If you are using Vite, you may need to configure `vite.config.ts` to define this variable or use a plugin like `vite-plugin-env-compatible`.*

4.  **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Launch the App**

    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

```

## Troubleshooting

-   **API Errors**: If analysis fails, check your `.env` file to ensure the API key is correct and has credits/quota available.
-   **Image Upload Issues**: Ensure images are JPG or PNG and under 5MB.
-   **Build Errors**: If using a fresh Vite install, ensure you have installed the specific dependencies: `@google/genai`, `lucide-react`, and `react-dom`.
